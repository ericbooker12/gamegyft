# GameGyft
## Money 20/20 Hackathon project
GameGyft is a Sinatra/Rails app to send a fun, age-appropriate (game-type) experience and a Gyft Card to a friend. It utilizes VisaDirect and Marqueta APIs to fund the gift card.

The current iteration for the Hackathon features a counting game -- if time had permitted, we would have created an **Augmented Reality Treasure Hunt**!

## APIs
VisaDirect  
Marqeta  

### Context
In 2015, Gift Card sales reached a new peak of $130 BILLION dollars. Holidays, birthdays, celebratory occasionsâ€¦ The versatile gift card is an easy gift... but can it *seem* too easy and thereby leave us feeling guilty for not sending a more personalized gift?   

The underlying psychology of giving weaves a complex web of emotions. GameGyft alleviates this dynamic by adding personalization and delight to the gift card industry.
